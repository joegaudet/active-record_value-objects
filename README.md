# ActiveRecordValueObjects

A simple gem to allow you to store value objects in your ActiveRecord models backed by jsonb columns.

## Motivation

Sometimes you want to store structured data in a jsonb column in your database. This gem allows you to define a value object that can be stored in a jsonb column and provides a simple way to define the schema of the value object.

This lets you store objects without needing to do complex joins or create additional tables.
## Example

```ruby
class Address < ActiveRecordValueObjects::ValueObject
  attribute :street, Types::String
  attribute :city, Types::String
  attribute :state, Types::String
  attribute :zip, Types::String
end

class User < ApplicationRecord
  value_attribute :address, Address 
end
```

Values are immutable by default, but you can easily make copies of them with changes:

```ruby
new_address = Address.new(street: '123 Main St', city: 'Springfield', state: 'IL', zip: '62701')
  .copy_with(city: 'Chicago')
```
## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'active_record_value_objects'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install active_record_value_objects
